## Current Features

**Dad Joke:**
When a user has any variation of the words `I am` or `I'm` in their message the bot will reply accordingly.

**Youtube Search:**
A user can trigger a youtube video search by beginning their search with `yt`, the bot will take whatever comes after it and retrieve 5 matching videos to select from. The user can then reply with a number between 1-5 for a video URL in the chat.

**More coming, suggestions welcome!**
